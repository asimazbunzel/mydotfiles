# STEP BY STEP to setup my Manjaro Linux install

# sometimes, lightdm does not work, i dont know why
# to solve this, set logind-check-graphical=true in
# /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf

# clone dotfiles to ~/Documents/dotfiles (because I like that place)

# change shell to zsh
chsh -s $(which zsh)

# install luke's smith fork of ST (https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st)
# I will install it in ~/.local/bin, but maybe /opt should be better ?

# make symlink for dotfiles to respective places ($HOME and $HOME/.config)
# start with .gitconfig, .zprofile and .config/zsh. If .config/zsh is not sourced, 
# create $HOME/.zshenv and put "ZDOTDIR=$HOME/.config/zsh". This should fix it 

# install oh-my-zsh, then p10k (remember to install MesloLGS fonts in
# ~/.local/share/fonts)

# symlink .Xresources to $HOME (delete existing file)

# change st config.h to have a nicer cursor shape in line 158

# install polybar (yay -S polybar) & symlink polybar/config to .config/polybar
# install fonts: (yay -S ttf-iosevka) (https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji)
# install libxft-bgra from the AUR: yay -S libxft-bgra to solve issues with emojis

# remove i3 config from ~/.i3 and symlink to .config/i3
# copy scripts to .local/bin/polybar for weather and updates
# to solve issue with powerlines, download Iosevka nerd font from this link:
# https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads

# solve issue with oh-my-zsh plugin: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md

# create also the script shortcutsrc and make it work with magic

# install neovim and symlink config

# install conda in .local/bin and install pynvim using conda install -c conda-forge pynvim

# create symlink for conky and to be able to use symbols, install:
